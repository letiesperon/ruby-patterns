# Ruby Patterns Applied

## Intention

Code snippets used on @santib and @letiesperon talk "Level up your Rails with Smart Patterns"

Rails aims to make development fast, but it has its drawbacks. Many Rails features or techniques do not really promote some key principles for maintainable code, which come back to bite us later on. We want to share with you our recent experience on a project and how we could have applied some incredibly useful patterns that would have made a big difference on our day to day productivity.
